\section{Conclusion}
In this row of experiments, we learned to measure the viscosity of fluid with two different methods, by throwing a little bowl into a tube, filled with this liquid and by letting it flow through very thin capillaries and using Stoke's drag and Hagen-Poiseuille's-Law to calculate the viscosity afterwards.\\
The determined viscosity seems reasonable in all three experiments, even though the viscosity, determined with the Ubbelohde-viscometer is not correct, even in the range of the errors, but is still close to the correct value. The possible reasons have been discussed in section \ref{sec:aufgabe1}.
