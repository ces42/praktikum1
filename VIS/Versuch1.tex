Our measurements yield a mean of $\unit[339.2]{s}$ with a corrected standard deviation of the mean of $\unit[0.4]{s}$. It is plausible to assume that there could be a systematic error of maybe $\unit[0.3]{s}$ (due to the fact that everybody tends to stop the time a bit too late at the end, for example). The resulting total error is $\unit[0.5]{s}$. The kinematic viscosity is calculated as
\[
    \nu = K t = \unit[(957.6 \pm 1.4)\e{-9}]{m^2 s^{-1}}
\]
The temperature of the water was measured as $(22.8 \pm 0.5)\C$, which according to the Literature%
\footnote{\url{http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=density+of+water+at+22.8+celsius}. The values from Wolfram Alpha perfectly agree with those provided by \\ \textsc{David R. Lide}: Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, CRC Press, 85. Edition, Page 6--2}
corresponds to a density of $\rho = \unit[(997.6 \pm 0.1)]{kg\,m^{-3}}$. We therefore calculate for the viscosity
\[
    \eta =  \nu \rho = \unit[(0.9553 \pm0.0014)]{mPa\,s}
\]
This value does not agree very well with the value found in Literature%
\footnote{\url{http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=viscosity+of+water+at+22.8+c}}
of $\eta = \unit[(0.937 \pm 0.011)]{mPa\, s}$
